# OpenGL Demo

A small OpenGL Demo with the purpose of learning rudimentary graphics programming in C++.

If you want to run the demo you need the assets folder (models and textures). 
Email me if youre interested magnus.c.soderberg@gmail.com
 
Uses the following dependencies:
ASSIMP - loading models
GLEW - obtain OpenGL functions
GLFW - rendering context and user inputs
GLM - vector/matrix math
IMGUI - GUI
NLOHMANN/JSON - Serialize/deserialize data using JSON
stb_image.h - loading textures
 
All other code written by me. All models made by me.
